# Tobii Stream Engine Rust Bindings

This is a Rust crate containing FFI bindings and a few helpers for working with the [Tobii Stream Engine](https://tobii.github.io/stream_engine/) library for interfacing with Tobii eye trackers like the 4C and 5.

The linker parameters are currently set up with the Windows DLL, but with some tweaking of the linker attributes it should work on Mac OS as well.
